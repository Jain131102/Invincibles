# GFG VIT-AP HACTOBERFEST Hackathon 

Problem Statement - 
Create an efficient online health practice management website for doctors and patients. Users can register or log in with their credentials to access their profiles. Key features include appointment scheduling for both doctors and patients, the ability for doctors to upload X-rays and files, and the ability for patients to view them. The platform should also facilitate treatment planning by offering alternatives, cost estimates, and bill generation. This process should be seamless for both doctors and patients.
